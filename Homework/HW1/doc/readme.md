## Homework_1: Linear-search Steepest Gradient Descent

#### 1. Requirement

* The code is written by python 3.8.
* Two packages should be installed in advance:   numpy==1.21.2, matplotlib==3.4.3
* The code has been tested in Ubuntu 20.04

#### 2. Run

* You need firstly find the code under the dir `/code/optimize.py`

* You can see the help by input the following code in your Terminal.

   ~~~shell
   python optimize.py -h
   ~~~

* To run the code, you need input one parameter. The parameter explanation is given bellow.

  ~~~shell
  Linear-search Steepest Gradient Descent
  
  positional arguments:
    dimension    Dimension of Rosenbrock Function, type=int
  ~~~
  
* You can run the code as follow

  ~~~shell
  python optimize.py 10
  ~~~

#### 3. Result

* The program will firstly show the visualization of a 2D Rosenbrock function and its optimization result.

* The program will secondly print the information of the optimization algorithm for a N dimension Rosenbrock function.

* An example is shown bellow which is the result of `python optimize.py 10`
